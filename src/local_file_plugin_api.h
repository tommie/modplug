/**
	Spotify Local File Plugin API
	=============================
	This file describes the API Spotify exposes for adding support for parsing
	and playing music file formats in Spotify.

	Building
	--------
	1. Implement this API, and export the symbol SpotifyLocalFilePlaybackPluginCreate
	   (see bottom of document).
	2. Create a folder called [your plugin name].splugin
	3. Compile your source into a dynamic library for your platform.
	4. Put the compiled library into
	   [name].splugin/Contents/[MacOS|Win32|{some platform}]/{name}
	   (append .dll if the platform is Windows)
	5. Repeat 3 and 4 for each platform you wish to support.

	(You can also just rename your dynamic library to
	 [your plugin name].splugin if you only wish to support a single platform)

	Installing
	----------
	MacOS: Install the .splugin into
		   ~/Library/Application Support/Spotify/Plug-Ins/LocalFile/
		   (or any other domain)
	Windows: [TBD]
	Linux: [TBD]
